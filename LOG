First commit.
Created the classes for the main board and the main character.
CURRENT STATE: Right now the program produces a black board and allows the user to move Leon around the screen

11/4/2012 1:15 AM (really 2:15 due to daylight savings)
Added the ability to shoot bullets
Added an enemy class. Right now its using a zombie as a picture. The Enemy class will be a superclass for all of the possible enemy subclasses.
Added collision detection for the enemies and Leon as well as the bullets and the enemies
CURRENT STATE: Program produces a black board with Leon and a zombie moving towards him. Leon can shoot bullets (unlimited for now). When a bullet makes contact with the zombie, it will disappear.

11/5 6:30 AM
Added subclasses of the Board class for individual rooms. These subclasses will eventually have the scenery, enemy placement, and door placement specific to the room.
Added an Entrance class and a picture of a door to go to new areas
Problems: In Main...
	Not recognizing room1 as the current class
	Doesn't seem like the changeRoom boolean is being set properly 
CURRENT STATE: Program produces the same output as previous with the addition of a door on the left of the screen

11/7 11:41 PM
Redesigned the project: Now uses only one Board class that repaints when Leon enters (intersects) a door.
Added checkChangeRoom() method. This will eventually need to check all current rooms then remove the current objects from all ArrayLists (enemies, entrances, bullets, scenery) and then create new objects corresponding to the new room and finally add them to the appropriate arrays.
CURRENT STATE: Program produces an inital grey screen with Leon, one zombie, and a door. Leon can shoot and move in all directions. The zombie is always moving on a constant horizontal plane for now. Now when Leon moves into the door, all the objects from the ArrayLists are removed and a new scene is painted with a black background and a door in a new location. This is the foundation for changing rooms.

11/10 12:10 AM
Added boundaries for Leon and enemies  so they cannot walk of the screen.
Enemies now move all the way to the left of the screen and then move to the right when they reach the edge of the frame, so on and so forth. Still only hoirzontially
Added SceneObject class for adding scenery -- Added fire to the first screen
Implemented collison detection between Leon and the scenery in all directions. Leon cannot move into scenery.
CURRENT STATE: Program produces an initial black screen with Leon, one zombie, a door, and fire to above and below Leon (placement for testing purposes now). Zombie moves horizontally left, and back to the right when it reaches x coordinate 0. Entry to new room works the same as it did in the previous commit.

11/12
Fixed bug where bullets could not be shot after entering a new room. Moved the remove bullet code to the check collision method (if Leon intersects with the door)
Moved the code for removing all the elements making up a room to a new method for cleaner code and easier readability.
Enemies now move in all directions towards Leon's current position.
Implemented collision detection between enemies and the scenery.
CURRENT STATE: Program produces an initial black screen with Leon, one zombie, a door, and fire above and below Leon (placement for testing purposes now). Zombie now moves in all directions towards Leon and is bound by the board and cannot pass through scenery. Entry to new room works the same as it did in the previous commit.
